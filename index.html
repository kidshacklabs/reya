<h2>what are some of the world's most endangred animals?</h2>
<h4>Ivory Billed Woodpecker</h4>
The Ivory-Billed Woodpecker is the most endangered animal out there. It lives in the Southeastern US and parts of Cuba. It is a huge woodpecker that was thought to be extinct until 2004.
Even now, there are only a a little bit of the woodpeckers that are still around. It is a very vulnerable animal. The Nature Conservancy, the US Fish & Wildlife Service, and some local communities have worked tirelessly for years to keep these  birds alive.<br><br>
<h4>Amur Leopard</h4>
<br>The Amur Leopard is a rare leopard found only in northern Russia's Primorye region. This region is very snowy and cold. The Amur leopard is also known as the Far East leopard, the Manchurian leopard or the Korean leopard.
The Amur leopard can run as fast as 37 miles per hour and has been known to jump more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet vertically.

This is a very endangred animal.it is very strong and it carries and hides unfinished kills so that they are not taken by other predators.Several males sometimes follow and fight over a female.

They live for 10-15 years, and in captivity up to 20 years.There are only 84 and some more adult Amur leopards alive in the world today.<br><br>
<h4>Lemurs</h4>
Lemurs are reconized by their long and bushy tails and they are only found in Madagascar and the Comoro islands.They are very unique and the most endangred of of all things living there. 

There almost no Lemurs remaining today.They might not be on the list of endangered species but there are few of these animals found today.<br><br>
<h2>fast facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>An animal is declared extinct after many years of not being spotted. Because it takes so long to define an entire species as extinct there are probably animals already gone that we don't know of.</li>
<li>99% of currently endangered species are at risk from human activities.habitat loss and global warming also play a part.</li>

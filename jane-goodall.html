	<h2>who is Jane Goodall?</h2>
	<p>Jane Goodall ; her full name Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall was born on April 3, 1934 in London England.
	She was intrested in animal behavior when she was really young, and left school when she was 18.<br>
 	She worked as a secratary and a film maker asisstant until she had enough money to go to Africa. When she got there she began helping paleontologist(the study of fossils and bones)<br>
 	and antropologist(the study of how humans live) Louis Leakey. Her asociation with Louis eventually led her to starting of a camp in the Gombe Stream Game Reserve (which is now a national park)<br>
	so that she could look and observe the behavior of chimpanzees in the region.</p>
	<h2>what did she learn?</h2>
	<p>Through her research, Jane Goodall was able to correct a number of
	 misunderstandings about chimpanzees. She found that the animals are omnivorous,<br> not vegetarian, they can make and use tools; and that they have social 
	behaviours.</p>
	<h2>fun facts</h2>
	<p>Jane observed animals from a young age. Once, she sat for five hours in her family's chicken coop to watch a hen lay an egg. 
	When she finally came out,she discovered that her family was really worried and had called the police to report her missing.<br>

 	Jane Goodall was first introduced to chimpanzees when she was a baby. Her dad gave her a toy chimpanzee when she was one year old.she named it Jubilee and for
	 years the toy remained with her. Even now,she keeps Jubilee on her dresser.</p>
